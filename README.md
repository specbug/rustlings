# Rustlings 🦀

Small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code!

This repository is a collection of small exercises to get you comfortable with reading and writing Rust code. It's designed to be a hands-on supplement to the [official Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

## How to use this repository

Each exercise is a small Rust file located in the `exercises/` directory. Most of them have a bug or a missing piece of code that prevents them from compiling or running correctly. Your task is to fix these issues!

1. Explore the exercises in the `exercises/` directory.
2. Follow the instructions in each file or the accompanying `README.md` in each subfolder.
3. Fix the code so it compiles and passes any tests.
