# My Rustlings Journey 🦀

This repository is where I track my progress as I work through the [Rustlings](https://rustlings.rust-lang.org/) exercises.

The goal is to get comfortable with reading and writing Rust code by solving small, targeted exercises.

## Progress Tracking

I am using this repo to:
- Store my solutions to the exercises.
- Track my learning path through the Rust language.
- Reference my own notes and implementations later.

## Structure

- `exercises/`: My current work and solutions.
- `solutions/`: Reference solutions for when I get stuck.
- `.rustlings-state.txt`: Tracking file for the rustlings CLI.
